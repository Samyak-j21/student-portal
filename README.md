# DSI Student Portal: A Modern Academic Toolkit üéì
Made and designed by Samyak Jain.

Hey there! Welcome to the GitHub repository for my DSI Student Portal. This project is a full-stack web application I built to create a centralized, user-friendly platform for students to access essential academic resources and powerful AI-driven tools. It's a significant project that showcases a wide range of skills, from front-end design to back-end logic and database management. I'm really proud of how it came together.

üöÄ Key Features
I've packed this portal with a few key features designed to make student life a little bit easier. Here's a look at what it can do:

Secure User Authentication: A robust login and signup system to provide a personalized dashboard for every user, with distinct privileges for students and administrators.

AI Chatbot: An intelligent chatbot that can answer academic questions, powered by an advanced AI model to provide instant and relevant information.

PDF Summarizer: Got a lengthy document? This tool allows you to upload any academic PDF and get a quick, concise summary, saving you valuable study time.

Smart File Management: For administrators, there's a dedicated portal for uploading files. You can systematically add notes, modules, or papers with custom titles and categories.

Organized Downloads: Students can easily browse, search, and download a comprehensive collection of academic files. The smart search bar lets you find exactly what you need, whether it's by title, category, or date.

üìÅ Project Structure
This project is organized into two main parts: the front-end (what you see) and the back-end (what makes it work).

frontend/: This is where all the user-facing magic happens! It contains the HTML for the page structure, CSS for the beautiful design, and JavaScript to handle all the interactivity.

backend/: This is the engine of the application. Built with Node.js and Express, it manages user authentication, API calls to the AI, file uploads to the cloud, and data storage in a MongoDB database.

‚ú® Getting Started
To run this project locally, you'll need to set up both the front-end and the back-end.

Clone the Repository:
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd [your-repo-name]

Set up the Backend:

Navigate into the backend/ directory.

Install the required packages: npm install

Create a .env file and add your environment variables for MongoDB, Cloudinary, and any other services.

Start the server: node server.js

View the Frontend:

Navigate into the frontend/ directory.

Open index.html in your web browser. You can use an extension like "Live Server" for the best experience!

üöÄ Ready for Hosting
This project is built for seamless deployment. With its decoupled front-end and back-end architecture, it can be easily hosted on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for the front-end, and Render or Railway for the back-end. The free tiers of these services are perfect for getting started and sharing this project with the world!

üíñ A Work in Progress

This portal is a reflection of my dedication to building practical, impactful applications. I'm excited about the possibilities for new features and improvements. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out. I'm always looking to learn and grow!
